19. An Overview of Redux
------------------------

documentation on basic concepts - redux.js.org/glossary

Two kinds of state:
Component level state -- has to do with a specific component
  example: a slider or dropdown menu. Open could be true or false.
Global state, or Application state
  example: an authenticated user, shopping cart item, orders

Redux is for application or global state
Our products are going to be used in multiple components.

Another possibility is to save your state in an App.js file and pass it around
through props, but that is frowned upon.

Terminology from the diagram

Components - react components
Server - our back-end django server
Reducer - state is changes through reducer functions
  These are functions that accept Actions and pass the state down to components
  The Reducer converts the payload data in the Action into a state.
  Multiple components can ask for the same piece of state.
Actions - objects that represent the intention to change a piece of state.
  Action creators - functions that fire off the actions
  Example: an action creator function, getProducts(). In that action creator,
  way make a call to fetch data and then dispatch an Action to the Reducer.
  The Action has a payload with the fetched data.
  
State is like a cloud hanging over your application.

Redux is not specifically attached to React.
You can use redux on its own or with other frameworks.
